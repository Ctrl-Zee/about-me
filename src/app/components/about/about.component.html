    <div class="bio">
      Since beginning my development career nearly 10 years ago I have enjoyed
      creating things that live on the internet. I’ve done work in both the
      public and private sectors, consulted for large enterprise applications,
      and collaborated with talented people to create quality production
      applications. I’m a big Angular enthusiast who is constantly working to
      improve my skills.
